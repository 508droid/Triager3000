How Does it Work?

The Triage Extension is designed to expedite the ticket creation process by auto filling the queue, primary resource, description, and ticket title.

Below is a step-by-step process on how to download, configure, and use the extension:

Setting Up the Extension:
Download the Triager3000 v1.6.zip attached on the right
Right click on the file and select "Extract All"
Open preferred browser--either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome
Microsoft Edge:
    
    1. Type this into your search bar: edge://extensions
    
    2. Enable Developer Mode
    
    3. Load unpacked

    4. Select the Triager3000 v1.6 folder twice until it looks empty like this

    5. Click Select Folder and now you have the extension in Microsoft Edge!

Google Chrome:

    1. Enable Developer Mode 
       
    2. Type this into your search bar: chrome://extensions
       
    3. Load unpacked

    4. Select the Triager3000 v1.6 folder twice until it looks empty like this

    5. Click Select Folder and now you have the extension in Google Chrome!

Configuring the Extension:
Click Details

      2. scroll down and click extension options
      3. Configure by following instructions below and click save to apply them


Hotkeys:
Hotkeys must use a combination of CTRL, ALT, or SHIFT and a letter key. Certain keys and hotkeys such as F5 and Ctrl+C are reserved by the browser so the F1-12 keys will not work and certain hotkeys may not work. 
Using the Extension:
Create a ticket
Do NOT use the 5 - Ticket Creation Template
Do NOT click into the text box

Now you are all set up!

Some Things to Note:
Make sure to edit ticket title to reflect department NOT job (e.g IT not IT Director)
callback number will pull the store number. If best callback number is different, change it
you will still need to accurately select issue/sub-issue and link the asset
